# Vendor Performance Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of vendor performance metrics to optimize procurement decisions and supply chain management. The project aims to evaluate vendors based on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as delivery timeliness, quality consistency, pricing competitiveness, and responsiveness.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AdilShamim8/Vendor-Performance-Analysis.git
cd Vendor-Performance-Analysis

# Set up virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```python
# Example code for running the analysis
from src.analysis import VendorAnalysis

# Initialize the analyzer with your data
analyzer = VendorAnalysis('data/vendor_data.csv')

# Generate comprehensive performance report
analyzer.generate_report()

# Get top-performing vendors
top_vendors = analyzer.rank_vendors(top_n=5)
print(top_vendors)
```

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes procurement data from multiple sources:
- Purchase order history
- Delivery performance logs
- Quality inspection records
- Vendor communication logs
- Price comparison data
- Customer feedback related to vendor-supplied components

## Analysis Methodology
The project employs several analytical approaches:
1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Statistical summaries of vendor performance
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting future vendor performance based on historical data
3. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommendations for vendor selection and management
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarking vendors against industry standards and each other

## Results and Insights
The analysis reveals key patterns in vendor performance and provides actionable insights for:
- Vendor selection and retention decisions
- Contract negotiation strategies
- Supply chain risk mitigation
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Quality improvement initiatives

## Future Improvements
- Implement machine learning models for predictive vendor performance
- Develop real-time monitoring capabilities
- Integrate with ERP and procurement systems
- Expand analysis to include sustainability and social responsibility metrics
- Create automated alerting for vendor performance issues

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the analysis methodology, add new features, or enhance documentation are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss potential changes.
